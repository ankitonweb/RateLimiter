# RateLimiter
Rate Limiting helps to protect services against abusive behaviors targeting the application layer like Denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, brute-force password attempts etc. These attacks are usually look like they are coming from real users, but are typically generated by machines (or bots). As a result, these attacks are often harder to detect and can more easily bring down a service, application, or an API.

Our Rate Limiter should meet the following requirements:

### Functional Requirements:

  - Limit the number of requests an entity can send to any application/API within a time window, e.g., 15 requests per second.
  - Ratelimit should be designed to work with applications running in clusture mode.
  - User should be notifed with an error message whenever the defined threshold is crossed.
  - Ratelimit should be able to adapt to the changed traffic conditions.  We should be able to throttle the rate limit on the fly without affecting services.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

  - The system should be highly available and scalable.
  - Our rate limiter should not introduce substantial latencies affecting the user experience.
